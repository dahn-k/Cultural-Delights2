    Tteokguk is a Korean traditional dish that is most 
    commonly eaten during Seollal, which is 
    basically Korean thanksgiving. It symbolizes
    the Seollal new year and the dish reminds us
    of the new year and the meaning of family. In Korea
    it is also said that 1 year is added to your age on 
    Seollal. There's a saying that one cannot get 
    older until they've eaten a bowl of tteokguk.

<p>
    As a kid my mom would make me tteokguk on other 
    occassions as well, like when the weather
    was cold or I was feeling sick. Since tteokguk
    is a very soupy and warm dish, it is perfect
    for those occassions.

<p>
    And now, for the <b>recipe!</b>
</p>
<h3>
    <b>You will need:</b> <br>
</h3>
<p>
   
    <li>1 pound store-bought sliced tteok rice cakes
         or homemade rice cakes (store-bought or homemade, 
         if they are frozen, soak them in cold water for 30 minutes 
         and drain before using)</li>
    <li>7 cups water</li>
    <li>½ pound beef (flank steak or brisket), 
        chopped into small pieces</li>
    <li>3 to 4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>1 dae-pa large green onion (or 3 green onions), 
        washed and sliced  thinly and diagonally.</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce 
        (or soup soy sauce to your taste)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 sheet of dried seaweed paper (gim aka nori)</li>
    <li>1 red pepper (optional), chopped</li>
</p>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>
    1. Bring the water to a boil in a heavy pot 
    over high heat and add the beef and garlic and cook 
    for 5 minutes.<br>
    <br>2. Turn the heat down to medium, cover, and cook 
    for 20 to 25 minutes until the  beef  is  tender 
    and  has  infused  the water  with  flavor.<br>
    <br>3. Roast both sides of a sheet of gim until it’s 
    bright green and very crispy. Put it in a plastic 
    bag and crush it by hand. Set aside.<br>
    <br>4. Separate the egg yolks from the whites of two eggs, 
    putting yolks and whites into separate bowls. 
    Add pinch of salt to each and mix with a fork. 
    Remove the stringy chalaza from the yolks.<br>
    <br>5. Add the cooking oil to a heated non-stick pan.
     Swirl the oil around so it covers the pan, and
      then wipe off the excess with a kitchen towel, 
      leaving a thin oily layer on the pan.<br>
    <br>6. Turn off the heat. Pour the egg yolk mixture 
    into the pan and tilt it so it spreads evenly and 
    thinly. Let it cook on the hot pan for about 1 
    minute. Flip it over and let it sit on the pan 
    for another minute, then take it off, slice it 
    into thin strips and set it aside.<br>
    <br>7. Add the rice cake slices to the boiling soup 
    along with fish sauce and kosher salt. Stir it 
    with a ladle. Cover and let it cook for 7 to 8 
    minutes until all the rice cakes are floated and 
    are softened throughout. Pour the egg whites by 
    little by little into the soup and cook for 30  
    seconds.<br>
    <br>8.Add sesame oil, ground black pepper, and 
    chopped green onion. Stir the soup. Remove from 
    the heat and ladle the rice cake soup into 
    individual serving bowls. Garnish with yellow 
    egg strips, crushed seaweed, and red pepper if 
    you want.<br>
    <br>9. Serve it right away, with kimchi and more
     side dishes if you want. If you wait too long 
     the rice cakes will get soggy, so everybody dig 
     in and enjoy!
